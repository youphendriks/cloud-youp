// This is a template for JSON files that can provide a standard way to add 
// new services to the cloud catalog, maintained with this repository. 

// Please create a new JSON file to add a new service to the catalog. While 
// creating that file based on this template, please consider the comments 
// below to fill the items to have a standard representation of services. 
// Please feel free to raise an issue or give feedback for the template in the // issues section (https://github.com/VHP4Safety/cloud/issues) of this 
// repository.

// [?OC] I believe we should set a list of minimum required information. For 
// instance, if there is no id, service or description, how do we create an
// item in the catalog? I think, there should be at least these three items, 
// and maybe an URL, whether to an external or internal address.

  // the JSON file that you are creating for the service. Please use only small
  // case letters and do not use spaces between words.

  // single-sentence description.

  // The name of the file for the service logo. Please use the same name as the
  // service id. 
  // [?OC] Do we really need this. We can check if there is a logo file in the 
  // createMarkdown file and if there's, it will put the logo. Although, then 
  // different file types (whether the logo file has a jpeg, png, or another
  // extension) might be a problem. 
  "screenshot": "",

  // An URL to the service. 
  // [?OC] Do we mean a general URL to the service, or the URL to the instance 
  // running on our servers. Based on that there is an "instance" section below
